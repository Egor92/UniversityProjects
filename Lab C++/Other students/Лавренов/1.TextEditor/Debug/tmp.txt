English is a West Germanic language that arose
 in the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Eng
land and spread into what was to be
come south-east Scotland under the influenc
e of the Anglian medieval kingdom of Northumbria. Following the economic,
 political, military, scientific, cu
ltural, and colonial influence of Great Bri
{
tain and the United Kingdom from the 18th century, via the British Empire, and
 of the United States since the mid-
20th century,[5][6][7][8] it has bee
{
n widely dispersed around the world, become 
the leading language of international disc
{
ourse, and has acquired use as l
ingua franca in many regions.[9][10]
 It is widely learned as a second language 
and used as an official language of the Eu
ropean Union and many Commonwealth
 organizations. It is the third most nativ

ely spoken language in the world, after Mandarin Chinese and Spanish.[11]

Historically, English originated from 
the fusion of languages and dialects, no
w collectively termed Old English, whi
ch were brought to the eastern coast 
of Great Britain by Germanic (Anglo-S
axon) settlers by the 5th century ï¿½ wit
h the word English being derived from the n
ame of the Angles.[12] A significant n
{
umber of English words are constructe
}
d based on roots from Latin, because L
atin in some form was the lingua franca
 of the Christian Church and of Europe
an intellectual life.[13
] The language was further influenced
{
 by the Old Norse language due to Vi
{
king invasions in the 8th and 9th centuries.
}

The Norman conquest of England in the
}
 11th century gave rise to heavy borrowings from Norman-French, and vocabulary and spelling conventions began to give th
e superficial appearance of a close r
{
elationship with Romance languages[14
}
][15] to what had now become Middle E
nglish. The Great Vowel Shift that began in the south of England in the 15th century is one of the historical events that m
ark the emergence of Modern English from Middle English.
}


Owing to the significant assimilation 
{

of various European languages througho
{
ut history, modern English contains a 
{
very large vocabulary. The Oxford Engl
ish Dictionary lists over 250,000 dist
inct
 words, not including many technical or slang terms, or words that belong to multiple word classes.[16][17]
